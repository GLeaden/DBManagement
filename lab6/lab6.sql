/*7. Whatâ€™s the difference between a LEFT OUTER JOIN and a RIGHT OUTER JOIN? Give 
example queries in SQL to demonstrate.(Feel free to use the CAP database to make your points here.)*/

/*

A left outer join will look at the items on the left side (the first table) of the two 
tables and attempt to match them with corresponding items on the right (the second table).

A right outer join will look at the items on the right side (the second table) of the two 
tables and attempt to match them with corresponding items  on the left (the first table).)

an example of  a left outer join is below. this query selects all of the cities in the 
customers table and any cities in the products table that match them
(we will have all the customer cities AND the cities from products that match the cities in customers)
*/

an example of a right outer join is below. this query selects all of the cities in the products table
and any cities in the customers table that match them
(we will have all the product cities AND the cities from products that match the cities in customers.
BUT IN THIS CASE we have some values that do not match up, so we will have NULL values in the table)
